Officially chartered in Singapore in 1992, ELSA aims to develop endoscopic surgery in Asia, share expertise, and set high standards for surgical practice. Today, ELSA is the leading regional body for endoscopic surgeons in the Asia-Pacific and a founding member of the International Federation of Societies of Endoscopic Surgeons (IFSES), with a governing body representing 37 countries from Turkey to New Zealand.',

        'description' => 'The International Federation of Societies of Endoscopic Surgeons (IFSES), founded in 1992, aims to promote Minimally Access Surgery (MAS) worldwide. Rather than being a federation of individual surgeons, it unites surgical societies with laparoscopic surgeons globally. IFSES provides a platform for sharing knowledge, enhancing endoscopic surgery, and disseminating MAS techniques. Established after the 1992 World Congress of Endoscopic Surgery in Bordeaux, the federation also benefits from strong partnerships with industry leaders, helping to advance and expand MAS worldwide.',
